# Windows API Stuff for GameMaker

Over the years I've needed a few different Windows features to work in GameMaker. So here's a DLL containing a few useful things.

The two batch files are a convenience because I'm too lazy to use a proper IDE and because I don't want to have to type out the command line arguments constantly.

Not all of the stuff in the DLL is useful. I don't actually know if the Windows Help stuff works. You can probably remove some of the includes without anything bad happening but I can't really be bothered right now.
